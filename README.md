<h3>Baseball</h3>
<p>This project is supposed to be modeled after a 1980's handheld baseball game. Playing this game is very simple and will be almost nostalgic to anyone who had played the handheld version in the 1980's.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>The latest version of this project is v1.0. <a href="https://github.com/KandBProject/Final/releases/download/v1.0/B--FinalProject.exe">Click Here for downloadable EXE file.</a></p>
<p>When you play, you need to first choose how hard you want to hit the ball. When you press the button, you will either get a strike, ball, or hit. If you hit the ball you may either get a foul, out, or safe. Always pay attention to the scoreboard in the top left-hand corner after every press of the button.</p>
